I used to be a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) from the year 2012 to 2019, mostly focused on Development Technologies. Now I am currently working for PerkinElmer Informatics R&D as a Principal Software Engineer.

I am a fan of Microsoft development technologies, specifically, .NET (C#). I am also interested in software architecture, OOAD, DDD, big data, AI and agile development methodologies.
